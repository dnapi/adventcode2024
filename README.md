adventcode 2024 in C++


I have prioritized speed and functionality over cleanliness and maintainability in this repository. The primary goal was to solve the challenges as quickly and efficiently as possible, focusing on algorithmic correctness and performance within tight time constraints. As a result, the code may lack comprehensive documentation, modularity, or polished structure. This repository showcases my ability to tackle complex problems under pressure and deliver working solutions within limited timeframes.
